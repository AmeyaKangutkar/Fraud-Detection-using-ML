# Fraud-Detection-using-ML
Analysis Thesis
Electronic money transfer via a device or mobile has increased dramatically in 
recent years due to the proliferation of smart phones. The simplicity of receiving 
and moving money has not only drawn users' attention, but also that of fraudsters 
and attackers. For fraud detection strategies, standard rules-based systems require a 
significant amount of time and work. As the amount of data increases, the 
traditional rule-based system will be unable to cope with such large amounts of 
data in a timely manner. As a result, flexible computational methods such as data 
mining and machine learning are utilized in fraud detection since they are key 
methods for identifying illegal fraud activities by attempting to rule out all possible 
false alarms and increasing real positive frauds. Here to discuss the financial fraud 
detection problem as a binary classification in the research. Machine learning 
techniques have been used to determine if a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent. 
To research employed five machine learning classification algorithms: Logistic 
Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K Nearest Neighbor 
(KNN), and XGBoost (XGB). As it reveals deep insights and the outcomes of the 
models utilized, these models are strong fitting and have a good ability to learn 
from the accuracy. Based on their accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC, and 
classification reports, three of the five models perform exceptionally well. The 
accuracy of these three models, however, is provided as XGB 93.2%, RF 92.9%, 
and DT 92.8%. From these models to can see that XGB is the best model on 
practical results but RF is the superior model based on the cost of models. But to
can conclude that all three models are best suitable for the prediction of fraud for 
this specific dataset and machine learning tools are most important in solving these
problems
